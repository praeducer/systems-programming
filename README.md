=================================

This four-hour course covers the basics of UNIX systems programming, including file and directory structures, basic and advanced file i/o, process creation, and interprocess communication.

Required Texts
---------------

+ C++ How to Program (7th Edition) Deitel and Deitel. ISBN 978-013611726
+ Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment (2nd edition) Stevens, Rago, ISBN 978-0321525949


Projects
---------

You are responsible to make sure that your program compiles and runs correctly on Odin, or as stated on the programming assignment.  
Each programming project assignment will include delivery instructions, deadline, and late penalties.  Evaluation of the projects will include 1) evaluating test cases using a pass or fail metric, and 2) programming style.  You are responsible to ensure that your programs compile, run, and are properly documented.  Proper documentation includes proper function commenting (i.e. purpose, pre-, and post- conditions) and explicit directions on how to compile and run your programs.
