Goal:
-------

Practice using templates and overloading.


Description:
------------------

In this short programming assignment, you will use an int nontype parameter numberOfElements and a type parameter elementType to help create a template for the Array class we examined in lecture, and also attached to the programming assignment. You will use this template to enable Array objects to be instantiated with a specified number of elements of a specified element type at compile time.


Class, Input, and Output requirements:
--------------------------------------

Write a program with the class template Array with the following requirements:
+ This template must instantiate an Array of any element type.
+ Override the template with a specific definition for an Array of float elements.
+ Your driver class is housed in Project5LastName.cpp (where LastName is your last name).
+ Your constructor, destructor, and output functions should all contain an output statement that indicates which definition version is being called, along with any other output needed.
+ You should also provide a working makefile as described in the submission instructions.
